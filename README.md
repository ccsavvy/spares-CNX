SparesCNX ~ Cat Knowledge Base

# Basic task
The app allows interested users to learn new facts about cats. Each fact on a screen looks like a picture with a
cat, under which there is text information, as well as the date when the fact was added. All facts are placed in a
vertical scrollable feed.
Initially, the user is shown a blank screen with an invitation to learn a new fact. When you click on the button in
the action bar, one random fact is loaded, as well as a random picture for this fact.
A random image is taken from the service https://cataas.com
A random fact is taken from https://catfact.ninja. I decided not to use https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/ as it is not working anymore.
The next time you click, a new fact and image are loaded and added to the feed.
